Welcome to Michelangelo, an authentic Italian restaurant nestled in the charming seaside town of Weston-Super-Mare.

This website is an independent homage to the restaurant, created out of admiration for their very high quality and enjoyable food. While it’s not officially affiliated with the restaurant, it’s been crafted with inspiration drawn directly from their exceptional dining experience. It aims to satisfy a restaurant's typical modern day expectation online allowing you to register, login and handle your bookings. All of this, while being able to view the restaurant in all its glory. We strive to provide a platform that not only allows users to explore and enjoy Italian cuisine, and those who appreciate good food and are always on the lookout for new culinary experiences.

Our restaurant is located on Knightstone Road, offering stunning views of the sea. Michelangelo is conveniently located at 50A Knightstone Road, Weston-Super-Mare BS23 2BE.

## UX


### Colour Scheme

My colour scheme is very basic and was chosen as I went along, to ensure readability was at a high priority throughout the development and tried to follow a ‘less is more’ approach. This approach allowed me to create a clean and uncluttered design, focusing on the essential elements and functionality of the website. I knew that if I picked a bunch of different colours it would lose a theme and overcomplicate the website, also compromising the readability and aesthetic I had going.

- `#343A40` used for primary text.
- `#202020` used for primary highlights.
- `#FFFFFF` used for secondary text.
- `#00FF00` used for secondary highlights.


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/f8f9fa-343a40) to generate my colour palette.

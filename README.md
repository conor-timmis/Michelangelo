Welcome to Michelangelo, an authentic Italian restaurant nestled in the charming seaside town of Weston-Super-Mare.

This website is an independent homage to the restaurant, created out of admiration for their very high quality and enjoyable food. While it’s not officially affiliated with the restaurant, it’s been crafted with inspiration drawn directly from their exceptional dining experience. It aims to satisfy a restaurant's typical modern day expectation online allowing you to register, login and handle your bookings. All of this, while being able to view the restaurant in all its glory. We strive to provide a platform that not only allows users to explore and enjoy Italian cuisine, and those who appreciate good food and are always on the lookout for new culinary experiences.

Our restaurant is located on Knightstone Road, offering stunning views of the sea. Michelangelo is conveniently located at 50A Knightstone Road, Weston-Super-Mare BS23 2BE.

## UX


### Colour Scheme

My colour scheme is very basic and was chosen as I went along, to ensure readability was at a high priority throughout the development and tried to follow a ‘less is more’ approach. This approach allowed me to create a clean and uncluttered design, focusing on the essential elements and functionality of the website. I knew that if I picked a bunch of different colours it would lose a theme and overcomplicate the website, also compromising the readability and aesthetic I had going.

- `#343A40` used for primary text.
- `#202020` used for primary highlights.
- `#FFFFFF` used for secondary text.
- `#00FF00` used for secondary highlights.


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/f8f9fa-343a40) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was used throughout the entire website with no secondary fonts.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, I used Font Awesome for my social icons and menu icons to display Vegan and Vegetarian dishes.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/conor-timmis/Michelangelo/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)


### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/conor-timmis/Michelangelo/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)


### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration


## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.


## Deployment


The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://michelangelo-e4d1cac07cf7.herokuapp.com)


### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

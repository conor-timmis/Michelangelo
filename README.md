Welcome to Michelangelo, an authentic Italian restaurant nestled in the charming seaside town of Weston-Super-Mare.

This website is an independent homage to the restaurant, created out of admiration for their very high quality and enjoyable food. While it’s not officially affiliated with the restaurant, it’s been crafted with inspiration drawn directly from their exceptional dining experience. It aims to satisfy a restaurant's typical modern day expectation online allowing you to register, login and handle your bookings. All of this, while being able to view the restaurant in all its glory. We strive to provide a platform that not only allows users to explore and enjoy Italian cuisine, and those who appreciate good food and are always on the lookout for new culinary experiences.

Our restaurant is located on Knightstone Road, offering stunning views of the sea. Michelangelo is conveniently located at 50A Knightstone Road, Weston-Super-Mare BS23 2BE.

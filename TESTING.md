## Code Validation

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static | base.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/base.png) | There are errors/warnings showing but they are because of my Django tags and the validator does not like them |
| home | index.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/index.png) | There are errors/warnings showing but they are because of my Django tags and the validator does not like them |
| menu | menu.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/menu.png) | There are errors/warnings showing but they are because of my Django tags and the validator does not like them |
| tables (create) | create_booking.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/create-booking.png) | There are errors/warnings showing but they are because of my Django tags and the validator does not like them |
| tables (delete) | delete_booking.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/delete-booking.png) | There are errors/warnings showing but they are because of my Django tags and the validator does not like them |
| tables (edit) | edit_booking.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/edit-booking.png) | There are errors/warnings showing but they are because of my Django tags and the validator does not like them |
| tables (view) | table_list.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/table_list.png) | There are errors/warnings showing but they are because of my Django tags and the validator does not like them |


### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static | style.css | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/styles.png) | Shows 1 warning of possible imported stylesheets (bootstrap for example in this case) |


### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
